Name:
Hanoi Tower

Description:
The hanoi tower is game we developed using python and brought to life(made interactive) using a package called pygame.
this game uses discs and rods. the player has to move the discs from rod A to Rod C is the fewest moves they can manage. 
the player can not place a big rod on a smaller rod and the moves the player makes are counted as the game goes to determine their cognitive abilities.

Installation:
to play this game you will need to have Pycharm installed in your PC(as the game hasn't been exported into an actually app yet) and you can download it for free on the internet
after installing the right environment to run the game, you will need to install a package called pygame to be able to access the GUI. 
to access the package just go to the bottom of the pycharm screen and click on package, search for pygame in the search box and install it.

Usage:
the game is very simple to run. once you have set up the environment and downloaded the package, right click on your screen and select run. a pop up screen will appear and prompt you
to select the number of disc you would like to play with, use the arrow keys to determine that, and then click enter. 
the game begins then. use the arrow keys to move the dics from one rod to another. you will receive a warning when you try to place a big rod on a small one, when you do, do not freight.
you just need remove the pop up and click on the GUI screen to proceed with your playing.
