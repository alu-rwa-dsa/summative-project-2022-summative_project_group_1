Because you can't actually divide codes among yourselves, writing codes and constructing a program can be challenging 
when you're dealing with people who don't contribute as much as needed.
However, in our group, we all participated equally to creating a working game application. 
We all gave it our all by attending meetings as needed and bringing all we had on our tables that we thought could be 
useful in some way. We only split the files in the end when we were consolidating to make good use of our time.
